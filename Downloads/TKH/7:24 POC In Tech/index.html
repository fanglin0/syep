                <h2>Hi, I'm Kande Sill 👋 </h2>
                <p>I'm a <span>full time student</span></p>
                <p>I go to <span>University Technical College</span></p>
                <p>I'm located in <span> the UK</span></p>
                <p>A little about me: <span>Hi, I’m Kande Sill—though I also write under the name Kande S. Summers—and I’m a 16-year-old student at University Technical College with a big passion for creative problem-solving. I was recently honored to receive the Arkwright Engineering Scholarship, one of the UK’s most respected awards for young engineers. I earned the scholarship for my project, Enhancing Medical Delivery, where I designed a drone-based system with insulated, secure packaging to safely deliver critical medical supplies to remote or underserved areas. I had the chance to share my journey on The Perfect Balance Trod Class Podcast, where I talked about the ups and downs of the process and the incredible support I received from my mentor, Vern Brown. He’s been a huge influence, and I’m so grateful for his guidance. I’ve always loved both engineering and art, and I believe some of the best innovations come from combining technical skills with creative thinking. My goal is to keep exploring that intersection and to help pave the way for more young women to break into engineering and bring new perspectives to the field.</span></p>

                        <p>Bernie Morris says: "These days, it's commonly believed that teenagers' brains are differently 'wired' from those of mature adults all over the world, which I guess explains teenage angst and all its associated problems. But this book points out that the wiredness (or maybe 'weirdness') exists, not only all over the world as we know it, but also all over the Universe. But, at the same time, some teens exhibit a rare wisdom and understanding that combines with innocence and just growing up. Loved this book."</p>

                        <p>From Haley: "...I couldn't get into this one, the writing was a bit bleh for my liking. It was mostly conversations between groups of people, but at times I found myself lost with who even was supposed to be talking. And even though it says "teenage" alien, it felt more so like a preteen book with the main character (Lizzy) and (Riley) constantly bickering about something. Would I recommend it? no, but hey it might be up the alley for someone else."</p>
